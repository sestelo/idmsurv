# survidm: Inference and Prediction in an Illness-Death Model




```survidm``` is an R package which introduces newly developed methods for the estimation of several probabilities in an illness-death model. The package can be used to obtain nonparametric and semiparametric estimates for: transition probabilities, occupation probabilities,  cumulative incidence function and the sojourn time distributions. Additionally, it is possible to fit proportional
hazards regression models in each transition of the Illness-Death Model. Several auxiliary functions are also provided which can be used for marginal estimation of the survival functions.



## Installation
```survidm``` is available through both CRAN and GitHub.
