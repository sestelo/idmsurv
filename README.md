# survidm: Inference and Prediction in an Illness-Death Model




```survidm``` is an R package which intorduces newly developed methods for the estimation of several probabilities in an illness-death model. The package can be used to obtain nonparametric and semiparametric estimates for: transition probabilities, occupation probabilities,  cumulative incidence function and the sojourn time distributions. Several auxiliary functions are also provided which can be used for marginal estimation of the survival functions.
